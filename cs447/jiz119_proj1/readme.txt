Jingxia Zhu(jiz119)
I haven’t finished moving enemies, and all the following:
	▪	Game over when shots == 0
	▪	Player ship looks different while invincible, and invincibility wears off after a time
	▪       Enemies move left, right, and down (and can’t go too low)
	▪	Number of enemies remaining is kept track of
	▪	Game over when all enemies destroyed
	▪	Enemies fire bullets (any enemy can, not just the same one over and over)
	▪	When player is hit by a bullet, a life is lost and player becomes invincible
I did extra credit for start_screen.
I did not make changes in display.asm, convenience.asm etc.
