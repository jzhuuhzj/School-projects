I haven’t finished the following:
	▪	Player ship looks different while invincible, and invincibility wears off after a time
	▪	Game over when all enemies destroyed
	▪	Enemies fire bullets (any enemy can, not just the same one over and over)
	▪	When player is hit by a bullet, a life is lost and player becomes invincible
I did extra credit for a start_screen.
I did not make any change in display.asm, convenience.asm etc.
